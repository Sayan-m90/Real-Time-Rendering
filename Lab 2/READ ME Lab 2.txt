This is a shooting game equipped with a gun and a moving target that randomly changes position.
The controls of the gun are:

w		move up
s		move down
space		shoot bullets
a		rotate gun- results in speed of bullet to slow down, each time you rotate the gun
1		rotate main/back handle- results in the target to scale down ( along the x-axis each time you rotate)
2		rotate second/front handle- results in the target to scale down ( along the y-axis each time you rotate)
Thus if you press 1 and 2 continuously and alternately, the target will disappear.
To win the game, you have to shoot the target atleast once.

In order to make the game more interesting, the target cannot be shot at a large distance when the gun is rotated.
So if the gun is rotated by more than 90degree, make sure you bring it really close to the target in order to shoot,
else the bullet passes over the target without making contact. You have to move up or down, bringing your gun closer so as
to make a successful hit.

Features:
All blocks are in 3D.
Two stacks are maintained, one for the gun, one for the target.
The bullets and target rotate in real time
There three user controlled rotational movements: main gun (with all sub parts), back handle, front handle.
MainDisplay() is used to display the main gun, from display we call mainDisplay() and control the bullet.
