READ ME FILE

Input parameters:
1. desired x-dimension of the screen
2. desired y-dimension of the screen
3. excel file name with .csv
4. point size of each point

I have used the following values as command line argument:
700 700 iris4.csv 5

I have implemented all functionailities with bonus point criteria.
Also find attached the iris.csv which is the same.
The snapshot of final output is also given.
Only number of species (=3) is hard-coded and all other parameters can be changed. 
So it should work with other csv files as well.
